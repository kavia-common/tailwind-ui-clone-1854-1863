# PPT Outline – UI Library App

## 1) Title Slide
- Ocean UI Library (React + Tailwind)
- Tailwind UI–like experience for teams
- Live previews, copy-ready code, fast workflow
- Ocean Professional theme, modern aesthetic
- Lightweight, extensible, production-friendly

## 2) Problem & Opportunity
- Design systems are slow to adopt
- Demos often lack copyable code
- Hard to onboard across teams
- Need fast discovery + previews
- Opportunity: practical, dev-first UI library

## 3) What This App Is
- React (CRA) + Tailwind CLI showcase
- Tailwind UI–style previews and code
- Three pages: Home, Components, Blocks
- Reusable preview cards, syntax-highlighted code
- Fixed navbar + sidebar navigation

## 4) Core Features
- Live component and block previews
- Toggleable code viewer (PrismJS)
- Copy-to-clipboard with fallback
- Persistent/collapsible category sidebar
- Smooth transitions and minimal design

## 5) Live Previews & Code Viewer
- Preview/Code tabs per card
- PrismJS syntax highlighting
- Section-only, copy-ready HTML snippets
- Show/Hide code per item
- Copy button with feedback

## 6) Navigation & Discovery UX
- Top navbar with active highlighting

## 9) How It Differs (Tailwind CSS, Tailwind UI, Tailwind Plus, Preline)
- Tailwind CSS: utilities; we add app UX
- Tailwind UI: paid patterns; we demo alternatives
- Tailwind Plus: package; we focus previews
- Preline: components; we add code-first flow
- Our focus: discovery, previews, copyable code

## 10) Why This App Fits as Best Companion
- Ideal alongside Tailwind CSS usage
- Bridges design and implementation
- Copy-ready snippets accelerate delivery
- Teaches patterns through live context
- Fits internal design system pilots

## 11) Developer Productivity & Onboarding Impact
- Faster onboarding via live examples ⚡
- URL-deep links for shared context
- Consistent PreviewCard and CodeViewer
- Minimal setup using CRA conventions
- Clear file structure for contributions

## 12) Architecture Overview (React + Tailwind)
- CRA + react-router-dom routing
- Pages: Home, Components, Blocks
- Components: Sidebar, PreviewCard, CodeViewer
- Tailwind via PostCSS; custom theme
- PrismJS for highlighting

## 13) Extensibility & Roadmap
- Add categories via uiCatalog.js
- New blocks via small factories
- Expand languages in CodeViewer
- Search/filter for discovery
- Optional dark mode theme 🌙

## 14) Demo Flow (suggested steps)
